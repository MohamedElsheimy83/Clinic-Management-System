# Clinic-Management-System-Project



## Context of the Project  
• Use the program to store patient data in digital format.  
• Eliminate the need to store, manage and retrieve papers.  
• Easier access to data.  
• Eliminate the risk of errors because all tasks are automated.  
• Using electronic files instead of paper saves time and effort.  
• Management of the waiting list or appointments in a simple and organized way.  
• Secure patient information in an external file (Backup) that can be used in case of data loss.  

This program can be developed for use in a hospital or even to meet the requirements of any other management system (for example: student and employee management).  
 
## Classes  

Class Patient :  
Attributes > id, nom, prénom, téléphone.  
Function to display patient data.  

## Data structures used:  

 **Map** : to save the user's login information (username and password) and allow quick access to the value using the key.  

 **Linked List**: to store patients efficiently because linked lists allow for better memory usage (memory allocation), they are more efficient than arrays. Unlike arrays, the size of a linked list is not predefined, allowing the linked list to grow or shrink in size easily.  

 **Queue** : to manage the waiting list (FIFO).
